[//]: # (title: Welcome to our tour of Kotlin!)

This tour covers the fundamentals of the Kotlin programming language and can be completed entirely within your 
browser. There is no installation required. 

If you have prior programming experience, then this is the tour for you! 

If this is your first time programming, 
don't be shy, give it a try! If it's too much, there's also our [Atomic Kotlin book](https://www.atomickotlin.com/atomickotlin/), or you can sign up for the free
